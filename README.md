# -Stable-Roomate
The stable roommates problem takes 2*n people and their preferences for roommates and attempts to assign them to n rooms. Each room has exactly 2 occupants and a successful matching will be stable. Stable means that in the rooms as assigned there are no two participants x and y, each of whom prefers the other to their partner in the assignment.
